# PocaKeeper
A smart budgeting app designed for students with unstable incomes and scattered daily expenses. By setting aside money for non-regular costs (like tuition, transport, or gifts) from the start, it helps you track daily/weekly limits, avoid overspending, and build healthy financial habits.
